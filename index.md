Sentences are the foundation of our language, and words our bricks. Supposing every document is a building, wouldn’t it be wise to ensure solid ground?



Ensuring writing accuracy under deadline is a heavy load one does not need to bear alone. PROOF can check your documents for typos, misspellings, and illogical statements, proofreading every word and suggesting edits where appropriate.



The types of media I can help you with include:



- Reports
- Dissertations and theses
- Term papers
- Promotional materials
- Novels
- Manuals
- Websites
- Apps
- Software



My past clients include KEXP, Pyramid Communications, Overlake Medical Center, the novelist Will North, Arts Corps, ARUP, and WSDOT. My rate is $35 per hour, with a minimum of $17.50 for smaller jobs. I can turn documents around at the rate of ten pages per hour, depending on density of content. Proofreading is done using AP style unless otherwise requested. Word and OpenOffice formats (.doc, .docx, .odt) are appreciated.

> *I used Hunter Richards’ services to proofread my doctoral dissertation. His work is extremely thorough, timely, and thoughtful. He found countless spelling and grammatical errors, and proofed the work to near perfection. I confidently endorse his work and would happily use his proofing services again.*
